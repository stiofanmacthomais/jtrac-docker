# JTrac 2.1.0
JTrac is a nifty opensource issue tracking system created by Peter Thomas.  It's fully self-contained, featuring it's own web server (Jetty) and database (HSQLDB).  It's highly configurable!

The code here is designed to be run with Docker and/or Docker Compose

The software comes with great notes at /doc/html/index.html.
